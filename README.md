### Hi, I'm Zeynep 👋

I'm an Electrical & Electronics Engineering student interested in **software development, game technology, and Python-based projects**.  
I currently focus on **Python**, **Unity & C#**, and building small projects to improve my engineering and programming skills.

### 🔧 What I work on
- Python projects & algorithm practice (LeetCode)
- Unity & C# fundamentals (game development basics)
- Personal learning projects (CLI tools, small simulations, etc.)

### 🤖 Past Experience (FRC Robotics)
Previously, I worked as a software developer in **Qubit Robotics** for multiple seasons during high school.  
I contributed to robot control logic, drivetrain behavior and sensor-based features.  
Even though I'm not active in robotics anymore, the experience strongly shaped my engineering foundation.

### 📌 Pinned Projects
- **FRC Code Archieve**
- **Python Practise / LeetCode Notes**
- **Cyber-Secured-Seismograph**
- **Rig-Engineer**
